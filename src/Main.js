            <p>
              My name is Isabella Lizarde, and I'm a Front-end Web Developer
              based in California. I've always had a passion for creating
              beautiful works of art and bringing things to life visually.{" "}
              <br /> <br /> As a former art major, I believe that Front-end
              development is a perfect combination of art and logic, and I truly
              enjoy creating engaging, user friendly websites. <br /> <br />{" "}
              When I'm not coding, I like to spend my free time with my dogs,
              listening to music, or catching up on the most recent video game
              I've been playing! ðŸŽ®
